An interactable security camera project with a 3d printed case and desk clamp attachment. The microcontroller used is an ESP-32 CAM Wrover Module from FreeNove, which comes with its own camera, Bluetooth and WIFI capabilities, as well as being compatible with the Arduino IDE. Electronic functions include ultrasonic sensor and LED for person detection, buzzer sounds for authentication process and servo motor for panning motion. Authentication and motor movement controlled using an IR sensor and remote. The camera model was designed in Solidworks, and the adjustable desk clamp was designed in Fusion360. Both were 3d printed using an Ender V3-SE printer.
